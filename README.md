# Weather Dashboard

## What I did

- I first started with the search button and adding in the weather API and made sure I was recieving data from the API
- I then created the "displayWeather" so that I can show the data given from the API
- I displayed the data in order, date, icon, temp, humidity, and wind speed. I once I added these I made sure that all the data was correct and accurate
- Once the current day weather was completed, I then started to add the "5Day" weather forecast for the next 5 days
- Once I completed that I then added the local storage function so I could save the previously searched cities forecast
- I then added A click event for the "history" search so that you can always go back to the previous forecast you recently searched
- Then finally once everything was functioning fine I then added simple styling becasue of time restraint
